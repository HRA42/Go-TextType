## Changes
- Added a button for selecting if the enter key should be pressed or not after the password is entered.
  - This is useful for entering passwords, and you want to press enter to submit the password.
    - Without this option, the enter key would be pressed regardless of users' choice.
  - The user's choice is stored in the `EnterKey` field in the `hotkey.gob` file.
  - The default value is `false`.
